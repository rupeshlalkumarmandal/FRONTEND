### Practicing CSS Display and Visibility (Beginner Level)

In CSS, the **display** and **visibility** properties are crucial for controlling how elements are shown or hidden on a webpage. By understanding these properties, you can control the layout and behavior of elements effectively.

Let's dive into how you can practice and understand `display` and `visibility` at the beginner level.

### CSS Display Property

The `display` property controls the layout of an element and how it interacts with other elements on the page. Common `display` values include:

1. **block**: The element starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
2. **inline**: The element does not start on a new line, only taking up as much width as necessary.
3. **inline-block**: The element behaves like an inline element but allows width and height to be set.
4. **none**: The element is not displayed and doesn’t take up any space.

### CSS Visibility Property

The `visibility` property controls whether an element is visible or hidden, but unlike `display: none;`, it reserves the space for the hidden element.

- **visible**: The element is visible (default).
- **hidden**: The element is invisible but still takes up space.

### How to Practice CSS Display and Visibility

#### **Step 1: Set Up HTML File**

Create a basic HTML structure to experiment with `display` and `visibility`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Display and Visibility Practice</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>CSS Display and Visibility Practice</h1>
    <div class="block">This is a block-level element</div>
    <div class="inline">This is an inline element</div>
    <div class="inline-block">This is an inline-block element</div>
    <div class="none">This element is hidden using display: none;</div>
    <div class="visible">This element is visible</div>
    <div class="hidden">This element is hidden using visibility: hidden;</div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### **Step 2: Apply Basic CSS Styles**

Add basic styles for each element to help visualize the differences between the properties.

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

div {
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 10px;
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Block-level element */
.block {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: lightcoral;
}

/* Inline element */
.inline {
    display: inline;
    background-color: lightblue;
}

/* Inline-block element */
.inline-block {
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: lightgreen;
    width: 150px;
    height: 50px;
}

/* Display none */
.none {
    display: none;
}

/* Visibility visible (default) */
.visible {
    visibility: visible;
    background-color: lightgray;
}

/* Visibility hidden */
.hidden {
    visibility: hidden;
    background-color: lightpink;
}
```

### Explanation of Each Property

#### 1. **Block-Level Element (`display: block;`)**
   - Block elements take up the entire width of their container and start on a new line. This is great for elements like `<div>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>`.

#### 2. **Inline Element (`display: inline;`)**
   - Inline elements don't start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. This is useful for text or small inline components like `<span>`.

#### 3. **Inline-Block Element (`display: inline-block;`)**
   - Inline-block elements behave like inline elements but allow you to set the width and height. This is perfect for creating flexible layouts without forcing elements onto new lines.

#### 4. **Hidden Element with Display None (`display: none;`)**
   - The element is completely removed from the layout and does not take up space on the page.

#### 5. **Visibility Hidden (`visibility: hidden;`)**
   - The element is hidden but still takes up the same space in the layout. This is useful if you want to hide content without affecting the layout.

### Step 3: Test in Browser

After adding the HTML and CSS, open the file in a browser to see the differences between the elements. Notice how the block element takes up the full width, the inline elements are next to each other, and the hidden elements behave.

### Practice Challenges

1. **Toggle Display and Visibility**:
   - Create a button that toggles between showing and hiding elements using `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;`.
   
2. **Make an Inline Navigation Bar**:
   - Create a navigation bar where each item is an inline-block element. Make sure you can adjust their width and height while keeping them on the same line.

3. **Experiment with Hidden Elements**:
   - Add some hidden elements using `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;`. See how the layout changes and how the hidden element with `visibility: hidden;` still occupies space.

4. **Create a Flexible Layout**:
   - Use a combination of block, inline, and inline-block elements to create a flexible, responsive layout. For example, create a gallery where images are inline-block elements.

### Example of Toggling Display

To take your practice further, you can use JavaScript to toggle the display and visibility properties.

#### Add a Button to Toggle Visibility

```html
<button onclick="toggleVisibility()">Toggle Visibility</button>
<div id="toggle-element">Toggle my visibility!</div>
```

#### JavaScript to Control Visibility

```javascript
function toggleVisibility() {
    const element = document.getElementById('toggle-element');
    if (element.style.visibility === 'hidden') {
        element.style.visibility = 'visible';
    } else {
        element.style.visibility = 'hidden';
    }
}
```

You can also apply the same approach for toggling `display` using `display: none;` and `display: block;`.

### Conclusion

By practicing with `display` and `visibility`, you’ll learn how to control the layout and appearance of elements effectively. Understanding the difference between hiding elements (with `visibility` vs. `display`) and how block, inline, and inline-block elements behave will help you build flexible and responsive layouts.
