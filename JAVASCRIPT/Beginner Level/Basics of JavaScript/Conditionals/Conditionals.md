Let's focus on **conditionals** in JavaScript, which allow you to control the flow of your program based on different conditions.

### 1. **What are Conditionals?**
Conditionals allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. In JavaScript, the primary conditional statements are:
- **if**
- **else if**
- **else**
- **switch**

### 2. **Types of Conditional Statements**

#### **2.1 `if` Statement**
The `if` statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

```javascript
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}
```

#### **2.2 `else` Statement**
The `else` statement specifies a block of code to execute if the condition in the `if` statement is false.

```javascript
let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}
```

#### **2.3 `else if` Statement**
You can use `else if` to specify a new condition to test, if the previous condition is false.

```javascript
let age = 65;

if (age < 18) {
  console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
} else if (age >= 60) {
  console.log("You are a senior citizen.");
} else {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}
```

#### **2.4 `switch` Statement**
The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions, making it cleaner when you have multiple cases.

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";

switch (fruit) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("You selected an apple.");
    break;
  case "banana":
    console.log("You selected a banana.");
    break;
  case "orange":
    console.log("You selected an orange.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unknown fruit.");
}
```

### 3. **How to Practice Conditionals**

#### **Exercise 1: Basic `if-else` Statement**
Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

```javascript
let number = -5;

if (number > 0) {
  console.log("The number is positive.");
} else if (number < 0) {
  console.log("The number is negative.");
} else {
  console.log("The number is zero.");
}
```

#### **Exercise 2: Age Checker**
Write a program that checks a person's age and prints whether they are a child, teenager, adult, or senior.

```javascript
let age = 22;

if (age < 13) {
  console.log("You are a child.");
} else if (age >= 13 && age < 18) {
  console.log("You are a teenager.");
} else if (age >= 18 && age < 60) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a senior.");
}
```

#### **Exercise 3: `switch` Statement**
Write a program that checks the day of the week and prints a message using `switch`.

```javascript
let day = 2; // 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, etc.

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Today is Monday.");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Today is Tuesday.");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Today is Wednesday.");
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log("Today is Thursday.");
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log("Today is Friday.");
    break;
  case 6:
    console.log("Today is Saturday.");
    break;
  case 7:
    console.log("Today is Sunday.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day.");
}
```

#### **Exercise 4: User Input (Bonus Challenge)**
Create a program that asks the user for their age (use `prompt()` in the browser) and prints a message based on their age category (child, teenager, adult, senior).

```javascript
let age = prompt("Enter your age:");

if (age < 13) {
  console.log("You are a child.");
} else if (age >= 13 && age < 18) {
  console.log("You are a teenager.");
} else if (age >= 18 && age < 60) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a senior.");
}
```

### 4. **Things to Practice**
- **if-else**: Write programs that use conditions based on numbers, strings, or boolean values.
- **switch**: Practice using `switch` for multiple cases, such as checking user input or evaluating different options in a menu.
