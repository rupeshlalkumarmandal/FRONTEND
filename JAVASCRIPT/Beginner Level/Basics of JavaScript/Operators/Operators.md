Let's dive into **Operators** in JavaScript and how to practice them. Operators allow you to perform operations on variables and values, such as arithmetic calculations, comparisons, and logical operations.

### 1. **Types of Operators**

#### **1.1 Arithmetic Operators**:
These are used for performing basic mathematical operations.

| Operator | Description               | Example              |
|----------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| `+`      | Addition                  | `5 + 3` → `8`        |
| `-`      | Subtraction               | `5 - 3` → `2`        |
| `*`      | Multiplication            | `5 * 3` → `15`       |
| `/`      | Division                  | `10 / 2` → `5`       |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder)       | `5 % 2` → `1`        |
| `++`     | Increment (increase by 1) | `let x = 5; x++;`    |
| `--`     | Decrement (decrease by 1) | `let x = 5; x--;`    |

#### **1.2 Comparison Operators**:
These are used to compare two values.

| Operator | Description                  | Example                   |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                     | `5 == 5` → `true`         |
| `===`    | Equal to (strict comparison)  | `5 === "5"` → `false`     |
| `!=`     | Not equal to                 | `5 != 3` → `true`         |
| `!==`    | Not equal (strict comparison) | `5 !== "5"` → `true`      |
| `>`      | Greater than                 | `5 > 3` → `true`          |
| `<`      | Less than                    | `5 < 3` → `false`         |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to     | `5 >= 5` → `true`         |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to        | `5 <= 3` → `false`        |

#### **1.3 Logical Operators**:
These are used to perform logical operations, often in conjunction with comparison operators.

| Operator | Description                     | Example                      |
|----------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND (both must be true) | `true && false` → `false`    |
| `||`     | Logical OR (one must be true)   | `true || false` → `true`     |
| `!`      | Logical NOT (inverse)           | `!true` → `false`            |

### 2. **Practicing Operators**

#### **Exercise 1: Arithmetic Operators**
1. Declare two variables and use different arithmetic operators to perform calculations.
2. Try combining different operations in a single expression.

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 3;

console.log(a + b); // Output: 13
console.log(a - b); // Output: 7
console.log(a * b); // Output: 30
console.log(a / b); // Output: 3.33
console.log(a % b); // Output: 1
```

#### **Exercise 2: Comparison Operators**
1. Use different comparison operators to compare values and log the result.
2. Test equality with both `==` and `===` to see the difference.

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = "5";

console.log(x == y);  // true (because it converts `y` to a number)
console.log(x === y); // false (strict comparison, different types)

console.log(x > 3);   // true
console.log(x < 10);  // true
console.log(x >= 5);  // true
console.log(x <= 3);  // false
```

#### **Exercise 3: Logical Operators**
1. Create logical expressions combining different comparison operators.
2. Try using `&&`, `||`, and `!` to combine conditions.

```javascript
let age = 20;
let hasLicense = true;

console.log(age > 18 && hasLicense); // true (both conditions are true)
console.log(age < 18 || hasLicense); // true (one condition is true)
console.log(!hasLicense);            // false (negating the true value)
```

### 3. **Combined Practice: Simple Program**
You can create a small program to combine these operators:
- Ask the user for their age and check if they are eligible to vote (age >= 18).
- Also, check if they are a senior citizen (age >= 60).
- Use logical operators to combine these conditions.

```javascript
let age = 25;

if (age >= 18 && age < 60) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else if (age >= 60) {
    console.log("You are a senior citizen.");
} else {
    console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}
```

### 4. **Things to Practice**:
- **Arithmetic**: Create a calculator that uses basic arithmetic operations.
- **Comparison**: Write a program to compare two numbers and print which one is greater or if they are equal.
- **Logical**: Write a program to determine if a number is within a certain range (e.g., between 10 and 50) using logical operators.
