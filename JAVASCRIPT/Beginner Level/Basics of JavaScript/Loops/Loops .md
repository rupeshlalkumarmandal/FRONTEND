Let's dive into **loops** in JavaScript, which allow you to execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition. The three main types of loops are `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

### 1. **Types of Loops**

#### **1.1 `for` Loop**
The `for` loop is often used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```
- **Initialization**: `let i = 0` sets up the counter.
- **Condition**: `i < 5` is the condition that controls the loop. It will run as long as the condition is true.
- **Increment/Decrement**: `i++` increases `i` by 1 after each iteration.

#### **1.2 `while` Loop**
The `while` loop runs as long as the specified condition is `true`.

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
}
```
- The condition `i < 5` is checked before each iteration. If it's true, the loop body runs. If false, the loop stops.

#### **1.3 `do-while` Loop**
The `do-while` loop is similar to `while`, but the condition is checked **after** the loop has executed, guaranteeing that the loop runs at least once.

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

### 2. **How to Practice Loops**

#### **Exercise 1: `for` Loop - Print Numbers**
Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i); // Output: 1, 2, 3, ..., 10
}
```

#### **Exercise 2: `while` Loop - Print Even Numbers**
Write a `while` loop that prints even numbers between 0 and 10.

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i <= 10) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
  }
  i++;
}
```

#### **Exercise 3: `do-while` Loop - Input Validation**
Write a `do-while` loop that keeps asking the user for input until they type "exit".

```javascript
let input;
do {
  input = prompt("Enter something (type 'exit' to quit):");
  console.log(input);
} while (input !== "exit");
```

#### **Exercise 4: Sum of Numbers Using `for` Loop**
Write a `for` loop that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

```javascript
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
console.log("Sum:", sum); // Output: Sum: 5050
```

#### **Exercise 5: Reverse Array Using `while` Loop**
Write a `while` loop to print the elements of an array in reverse order.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let i = arr.length - 1;
while (i >= 0) {
  console.log(arr[i]); // Output: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
  i--;
}
```

### 3. **Things to Practice**
- **Nested Loops**: Try using loops inside other loops, like printing a pattern (triangle or square).
- **Array Iteration**: Use loops to iterate over arrays and perform operations like summing elements or finding the largest number.

### 4. **Bonus Challenge**
Write a program using a `for` loop that generates the multiplication table for a number entered by the user (e.g., 5).

```javascript
let num = 5;
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(`${num} x ${i} = ${num * i}`);
}
```
