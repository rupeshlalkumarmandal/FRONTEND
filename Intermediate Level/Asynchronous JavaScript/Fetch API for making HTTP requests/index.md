### **Intermediate Level: Asynchronous JavaScript (Fetch API for Making HTTP Requests)**

The **Fetch API** provides a modern way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. It allows you to request and send data to and from a server, supporting promises for handling asynchronous operations.

---

### **What is the Fetch API?**

- The Fetch API is a built-in JavaScript interface for making HTTP requests.
- It returns a Promise that resolves to the `Response` object representing the response to the request.
- It supports various request methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more.

---

### **Basic Syntax of Fetch**

The basic syntax for using the Fetch API is:

```javascript
fetch(url, options)
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    return response.json(); // or response.text(), etc.
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data); // Handle the data received from the response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("There was a problem with the fetch operation:", error);
  });
```

- **`url`**: The URL of the resource you want to fetch.
- **`options`**: An optional object containing settings for the request, such as method, headers, body, etc.

### **How to Practice Using the Fetch API:**

---

### **Practice Task 1: Basic GET Request**

1. **Fetch Data from an API**: Start by making a simple GET request to a public API, such as the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

#### **Example Code:**

```javascript
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data); // Log the array of posts
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("There was a problem with the fetch operation:", error);
  });
```

---

### **Practice Task 2: Making a POST Request**

2. **Send Data to an API**: Use a POST request to send data to the same JSONPlaceholder API.

#### **Example Code:**

```javascript
const postData = {
  title: "foo",
  body: "bar",
  userId: 1,
};

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(postData),
})
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log("Post created:", data); // Log the response data
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("There was a problem with the fetch operation:", error);
  });
```

---

### **Practice Task 3: Handling Errors**

3. **Error Handling**: Modify your GET and POST requests to handle errors more gracefully by using `try/catch` with async/await.

#### **Example Code:**

```javascript
async function fetchPosts() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("There was a problem with the fetch operation:", error);
  }
}

fetchPosts();
```

---

### **Practice Task 4: Using Query Parameters in GET Requests**

4. **Make Requests with Query Parameters**: Fetch user-specific posts by adding query parameters.

#### **Example Code:**

```javascript
const userId = 1; // Change this to fetch posts for different users
fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=${userId}`)
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(`Posts for user ${userId}:`, data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("There was a problem with the fetch operation:", error);
  });
```

---

### **Practice Task 5: Updating and Deleting Resources**

5. **PUT and DELETE Requests**: Practice updating a resource with a PUT request and deleting it with a DELETE request.

#### **Example for PUT Request:**

```javascript
const updatedData = {
  id: 1,
  title: "updated title",
  body: "updated body",
  userId: 1,
};

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1", {
  method: "PUT",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(updatedData),
})
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log("Post updated:", data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("There was a problem with the fetch operation:", error);
  });
```

#### **Example for DELETE Request:**

```javascript
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1", {
  method: "DELETE",
})
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    console.log("Post deleted successfully");
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("There was a problem with the fetch operation:", error);
  });
```

### **Practice Summary:**

1. **GET Requests**: Fetch data from a public API and log the results.
2. **POST Requests**: Send data to an API and log the response.
3. **Error Handling**: Use `try/catch` to manage errors in async functions.
4. **Query Parameters**: Fetch specific data by modifying the URL.
5. **Updating and Deleting**: Practice PUT and DELETE requests to manipulate resources.

By practicing these exercises, you will gain a solid understanding of how to use the Fetch API for making HTTP requests in JavaScript.
